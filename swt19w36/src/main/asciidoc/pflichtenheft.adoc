== 1. Purpose of this Document

This document represents the Software Requirements Specification (SRS, German: close to a "Pflichtenheft") of the Software project task for the Best Food Catering GmBH KG. It aims to provide an overview of the software product to be built and functions as a basis for communication between the stakeholders of the project, mainly the client, Dr. Marvin Triebel, and the development team, Group 36. It is desired to have this document as the foundation for a contract between the client and the contractor, and should therefore be validated and checked for consistency. The SRS describes what the desired system has to fulfill and partially how the contractor intends to implement the solution.

In general, the SRS should be correct, complete, and consistent (CCC). As it is used at the end of the project to validate whether or not the defined software has been delivered, this goal should be verifiable. It is going to be used and consulted throughout the whole project which is why the contents should be traceable throughout all artifacts that are created. In conjunction with the above, it is desired to be simple to change and evolve, even though changes should be kept to a minimum after the stakeholders once agreed on the content. However, as requirements and circumstances constantly change during a project, adjustments are to be expected and have to be documented.

We aim to provide a SRS which fulfils the requirements stated above. However, we are aware that this document will not be fully complete due to the limited experience of the developers and the dynamic nature of software-development in general. Therefore, we invite the reader to make contributions if needed and to give constructive feedback.


== 2. Task Definition

The Best-Food-Catering GmbH & Co KG is an upcoming company that focuses on the special requirements for the supply of food to day-care centers, schools and corporations.

Due to the increased interest in child care in some states of Germany, there is a need to restructure the companies organization for significant growth and this includes a software-technical solution. In order to implement the software best, it is necessary to take a closer look at the structure and the requirements of the Best-Food-Catering GmbH & Co KG. Internally, there are these four areas: kitchen, accounting and inventory and the online ordering system as the interface to the customers.

A daily report is necessary for the kitchen. The report must include all meals to be cooked, with their respective amount and recipe. Different recipes can be included for each meal. Portioning occurs because kindergarten children receive a smaller portion than employees of a corporation.

All customer data records are managed in the accounting segment which is also responsible for the payment-request. Day care centers can choose between two payment models, individual and group payment. The group payment works as described below; all meals delivered to a specific day-care centre will be invoiced as a whole and the educators collect the money from the parents themselves.	 Due to the lower administrative costs, these day-care centers then receive a discount of 7% on the net price.

Corporations do not have the option of group payment. In the individual payment model, the employees, respectively the parents of the children, are invoiced their ordered meals directly.

Irrespective of the billing models, each customer can choose between direct debit and bank transfer.

All ingredients for production must be managed in the inventory. For all perishable products the best-before date must be observed; additionally, they are to be stored according to the FIFO principle. A weekly report is needed which contains all the reorders on the basis of the menu. If there are goods in the inventory whose shelf life has expired, they must be automatically removed from the system and the storekeeper must be informed.

In order to ensure a balanced diet, the menu is published one week in advance.	The parents or employees can then use the online ordering system to order meals. There are always three menu lines to simplify kitchen logistics. The first menu line is the normal one. For people with food intolerance there is a second line, called the diet menu. As a third we have the special menu line. For parents or employees to be able to carry out the ordering process online, they need a best_food_catering.user account – at the
end of the care of the child, or expiration of the Employment contract, the best_food_catering.user account will be deleted automatically. In principle, two separate menus are published for day-care centers and corporations in order to make portioning less laborious.

The following points could be added to increase the complexity if needed:

- Single packaging charge (juice packs, ketchup bags, ...)

- State coupons for children's meals (fixed amount)

- Free choice of beverage (then 19% sales tax)

- Possibility of a breakfast package

- Credits for children who did not attend meals (e.g. illness)

- Evaluation and comment function for specific meals




== 3. Product Usage
This section is going to give an overview of how the product is intended to be used upon completion and under which circumstances.

The system’s purpose is to provide an online interface for the customer referred to as “Online Ordering System”, to automate internal processes such as accounting and to smooth out the internal communication with the usage of reports.
The software is supposed to run on a server and to be available through the internet (via a browser) to customers and employees.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following browsers:

      - Mozilla Firefox, version 55.0.3+
      - Google Chrome, version 61.0.3163+


The primary groups of users are the customers and the employees of the Best-Food-Catering GmbH & Co KG – both cannot be expected to have a technical background.
All the different roles are described in detail below, however, we would like to mention the most important role, the so called “Boss”. The name Boss is meant quite literally as they have administrative rights in every subsystem of the Software.
Therefore they should have a deep understanding of the processes within the corporation and the software as well as a basic technical knowledge.

It should be noted that unfortunately on some prototypes the “settings” are missing in the navigation bar. Nevertheless, you can easily imagine how it looks with this option, because on some it is visible. From Order Meals to Cart those are the views of a regular user.
