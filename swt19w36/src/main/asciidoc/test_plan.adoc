== 1. Introduction
This test-plan is a simplified version of the IEEE 829-1998 template and lists
the requirements needed for several unit tests for the developers.

== 2. Test schema
We'll use the following schema for each test:

* U - Unit Test
* I - Integration Test

Example:

* U-1, U-12, I-4

== 3. Tests

=== 3.1 To be tested functionalities
* Every internal class and its methods

=== 3.2 Not to be tested functionalities
* Spring Framework
* Spring Boot
* Salespoint
* Java Persistence API

== 6. Approach
Each class will be tested with JUnit. Integration tests will follow the bottom-up principle.

== 7. Environmental requirements

No special hardware or software is needed for the tests to run. The application
has to be built & launched with Maven, which is already included in our project.

The web application will launch on localhost:8080,
so no internet connection is required.

No additional data has to be entered for the tests.




== 8. Test cases & responsibility
